# Projects

During our hackweeks, we invite participants to collaborate in small group project teams (usually 5-7 people). Depending on the size of the hackweek, we usually see between 10-15 project teams form. Embedding project work along with tutorials across the week offers participants multiple ways to deepen their learning around specific data sets, data science methods, and open science practices.

Each hackweek’s community of research scientists and domain practitioners generates the project offerings. While the projects are unique from hackweek to hackweek, they typically fall into one of the following categories:

* **Advancing a part of a research idea or ongoing effort**
* **Deepening tutorial learning with hands-on experience with data sets/tools**
* **Developing a new community tool or library**

# How projects are designed

On the following pages you will find more details on how projects are designed. This information is provided to help guide project leaders, but can be for all hackweek participants to be familiar with. 

We encourage all project leaders to be creative with their ideas and when planning out the project’s group work and learning opportunities. *The organizers will help each lead think through how to best scope the project* to match the desired outcomes for the group work. In the meantime, leads can consider the range of scoping options described in the table below to get a sense of where their idea may fall.

On the left, the project is less structured so that it can be adapted to where team members would like to take the project based on what they can contribute and want to learn. On the right, the project work is much more structured allowing participants to make quick progress on project goals and/or focused learning experiences. Then some projects are in between, a blend of focused, structured, and adaptable.

*Version 2:*

| Exploration | Adaptable | Focused |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scoped to explore an area of interest together | Scoped to be focused but with some adaptability | Scoped to clear goals & learning objectives |
| Project is centered on exploring a reserach challenge but can also be shaped to incorporate team's learning interests | Project is focues on 1-3 goals but can be shaped by team's areas of interest | Project is focused on advancing goals & team practicing specific skills |
| Team creatively applies knowledge & skills to challenge by co-shaping project on Day 1 | Hands-on experience into a tutorial topic; Application of data sets to research areas | Developing community products & libraries; Experience with ML data sets and research |
| + Preparation to explain problem & define tasks and skills | ++ Design & preparation to enable team to quickly organize & collaborate on tasks | ++ Design & preparation may be higher, if using AI/ML methods |


*Version 3:*

| | Exploration |  Focused |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Your team explores a variety of aspects with a new data set, tool, or method  | Your team works to develop a specific software tool or answer a specific research question |
| **Teamwork** | Team members can pursue their own specific learning goals within the broad project topic |  Team members work on specific tasks to accomplish project goals |
| **Preparation** | Project leads provide example data, code, and guidance to team members | Project leads provide well-defined and measureable goals |
