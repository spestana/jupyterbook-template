# After the hackweek

## **Communities of practice**

We aspire to keep projects going after the hackweek! This is an optional (ideal) outcome of hackweek project work.

* Project leads/helpers will transition to longer-term engagement via mentorship role (optional/with support).
* Additional people join a growing Community of Practice (for example, centered on a community software library).
* Software, research results are packaged and shared/published.
