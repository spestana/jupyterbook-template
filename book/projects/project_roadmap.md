## **Project ideation and team formation**

Though project ideation begins well before the hackweek event, it is expected that the process is ongoing and iterative, and will continue through the event itself with input from participants helping to shape or adapt project goals.

### Before the event

We invite those who are interested in leading a project to join our organizing team in the months before the hackweek. At a first kick-off meeting, project leads will be guided through brainstorming, identifying overlaps or connections between project ideas, and identifying common needs in hackweek tutorial content that will help projects be successful. After this initial meeting, project leads will work on defining their project by creating a github repository from the project template, defining project tasks, and outlining the anticipated skills that participants will apply in the project. This is all information that hackweek participants will be using to help them select a project team to join.

At a second meeting, project leads will again share their projects with one another. This gives them an opportunity to solicit feedback on the feasibility of the project scope, or raise any questions. During this meeting hackweek organizers will present information on how to effectively lead a group project, and guide the project leads through some activities to practice those skills. 

Around the time of the second meeting, hackweek participants will be browsing all of the project repositories, chatting with project leads on slack, and may begin selecting which one they would like to work on. Throughout the process, hackweek organizers will be available to answer questions and to help participants get connected with a project that fits their learning objectives.


### Day 1 of the event

We facilitate a project team formation session on the first day of the hackweek. During this time we will finalize project goals and objectives. Hackweek organizers and facilitators will help each team set reasonable goals and develop a roadmap for task completion.

* kick-off meeting focuses on hearing from each team member:
    * What are your unique learning goals? 
    * How do you work best? What level of group interaction works for you?
    * What skills and background are you most excited to share with the team?
    * When are you available to meet?
* set up team computing infrastructure on Slack and GitHub ([Project Initialization](project_initialization)) 
* project work begins and teams have regular check-ins to chart progress
* project outputs are recorded in a GitHub repository

## **Project teamwork**

### Each day of the event

* teams have regular check-ins to chart progress

### Sharing results

* each team has 15 minutes to share what was learned, what challenges arose, what might be worth trying next
* individual contributions to the group effort are recognized and celebrated

##**Communities of practice**

### After the event

* We aspire to keep projects going after the hackweek! This is an optional (ideal) outcome of hackweek project work.
* Project leads/helpers will transition to longer-term engagement via mentorship role (optional/with support).
* Additional people join a growing Community of Practice (for example, centered on a community software library).
* software, research results are packaged and shared/published.
