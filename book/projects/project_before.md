# Before the hackweek

## **Project ideation and team formation**

Though project ideation begins well before the hackweek event, it is expected that the process is ongoing and iterative, and will continue through the event itself with input from participants helping to shape or adapt project goals.

We invite those who are interested in leading a project to join our organizing team in the months before the hackweek. At a first kick-off meeting, project leads will be guided through brainstorming, identifying overlaps or connections between project ideas, and identifying common needs in hackweek tutorial content that will help projects be successful. After this initial meeting, project leads will work on defining their project by creating a github repository from the project template, defining project tasks, and outlining the anticipated skills that participants will apply in the project. This is all information that hackweek participants will be using to help them select a project team to join.

At a second meeting, project leads will again share their projects with one another. This gives them an opportunity to solicit feedback on the feasibility of the project scope, or raise any questions. During this meeting hackweek organizers will present information on how to effectively lead a group project, and guide the project leads through some activities to practice those skills. 

Around the time of the second meeting, hackweek participants will be browsing all of the project repositories, chatting with project leads on slack, and may begin selecting which one they would like to work on. Throughout the process, hackweek organizers will be available to answer questions and to help participants get connected with a project that fits their learning objectives.
